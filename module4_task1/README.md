# Module 1: Introduction to DevOps: Automate Everything to Focus on What Really Matters

## Learning Objectives

* This project aims at showing use cases where a DevOps mindset is bringing value to a software project by automating it, which decreases the amount of manual work and increases the development speed. It focuses on why automation is useful and helps speeding a development lifecycle.

---
Read

Understand the value of automating tedious tasks
Define a development lifecycle
Automate shell-like tasks with Make, and/or shell script
Be aware of tools dependencies and the value of reproducing environment
Build static HTML website from Markdown code using Go-Hugo

---
## Prerequisites

* The following elements are required In addition to the previous module (“Module 0: Linux Fundamentals, Code management with Git, GitHub and the GitFlow pattern”) prerequisites.

---
## Concepts

### Shell terminal basics, using command lines:
* Navigating in a Unix file-system
* Understanding how stdin/stdout redirection and piping
* Showing and searching the content of a text files
* Defining and using Environment Variables
* Adding command lines to your terminal using the apt-get package manager and/or with the PATH variable
* Writing and executing a shell script

### Git with the command line (and also a graphical interface)
* Retrieving or creating a repository
* Manipulating changes locally with Git’s 3 steps process (workspace, staging, history)
* Distributing changes history with remotes repositories

### Make/Makefile usage:
* Executing tasks through make targets
* Default target and PHONY target
* Makefile’s variables and macro syntax

---
## Tooling

* An HTML5-compliant web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, etc.)
* A free account on GitHub, referenced as <GitHub Handle>
* A shell terminal with bash, zsh or ksh, including the standard Unix toolset (ls, cd, etc.) with:
* .GNU Make in version 3.81+
* .Git (command line) in version 2+
* .Go Hugo v0.80+
* The student needs to be able to spawn up a clean Ubuntu 18.04 system. Therefore Docker is recommended with NO prior knowledge.
* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Editor) of your convenience (Visual Code, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ, etc.)

##  Development Lifecycle with Makefile
## following make file use `make` <command>
---
Files|Tasks
---|---
Build | Generate the website from the markdown and configuration files in the directory dist/.
Clean | Cleanup the content of the directory dist/
Post | Create a new blog post whose filename and title come from the environment variables POST_TITLE and POST_NAME.
### Write a Makefile to implement these steps for the actual Go-Hugo website’s source code.

# Workflow 
* Build Workflow 
* Clones the repo
* Github actions runs make build in this directory every day and after every push
* Go in the correct directory and execute the command `make help` to validate that the Makefile is present and implements the help target check.

## Target
---
 Command  | Tasks 
 ---|---
unit-tests | runs multiple make recipes.
package | creates a zip archive of the the latest build and stores it under `awesome-website.zip
integration-tests | runs make post and make build
clean | Cleanup the content of the directory dist/
build | Generate the website from the markdown and configuration files in the directory dist/
validate | prints out the pwd
post | Create a new blog post whose filename and title come from the environment variables POST_TITLE and POST_NAME
help | Print out all build recipes
lint | Lints the shell script setup.sh and on success runs make yamllint and lints markdown FILES
yamllint | Lints the `github-workflow.yml` file
markdownlint | lints the `README.md` and `DEPLOY.md` files
lint: ## to execute a static analysis to lint this code.
@shellcheck setup.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "Lint Failed"
